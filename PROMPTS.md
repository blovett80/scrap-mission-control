## Project Context
"As a sidenote: everything in this mission control is built with NextJS with a Convex database. Make sure to mention that to your Claw when you initially set this up."

---

## 1. Tasks Board

**Prompt:**

> "Please build a task board for us that tracks all the tasks we are working on. I should be able to see the status of every task and who the task is assigned to, me or you. Moving forward please put all tasks you work on into this board and update it in real time."

**Purpose:** Track who is working on what. Critical for proactive agent behavior.

## 2. Content Pipeline

**Prompt:**

> "Please build me a content pipeline tool. I want it to have every stage of content creation in it. I should be able to edit ideas and put full scripts in it and attach images if need be. I want you to manage this pipeline with me and add wherever you can."

**Stages:** Idea → Script → Thumbnail → Filming → Published

**Purpose:** Automate content creation workflow.

## 3. Calendar

**Prompt:**

> "Please build a calendar for us in the mission control. All your scheduled tasks and cron jobs should live here. Anytime I have you schedule a task, put it in the calendar so I can ensure you are doing them correctly."

**Purpose:** Visual confirmation of scheduled/cron tasks. Critical for proactive behavior.

## 4. Memory

**Prompt:**

> "Please build a memory screen in our mission control. It should list all your memories in beautiful documents. We should also have a search component so I can quickly search through all our memories."

**Purpose:** Visual memory browser with search instead of hidden markdown files.

---

## 5. Team

**Prompt:**

> "Please build me a team structure screen. It should show you, plus all the subagents you regularly spin up to do work. If you haven't thought about which sub agents you spin up, please create them and organize them by roles and responsibilities. This should be developers, writers, and designers as examples."

**Purpose:** Treat OpenClaw as a company with specialized employees.

**Example roles:** Developer, Writer, Designer

---

## 6. Office

**Prompt:**

> "Please build me a digital office screen where I can view each agent working. They should be represented by individual avatars and have their own work areas and computers. When they are working they should be at their computer. I should be able to quickly view the status of every team member."

**Purpose:** Visual status of all agents. Fun + functional for efficiency monitoring.

## Closing Advice

> "Most importantly: just enjoy it. Have fun. Not everything you do needs to be in an effort to optimize. Treat this as much of an art form as an optimization exercise. You're allowed to have fun when playing with AI!"
